# Bridge Design Pattern

Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

## Simple Example: Shape and Color
Let's consider a simple example where we want to represent different shapes (like circle, square) in different colors (like red, green). Without the Bridge pattern, we might end up with a large number of classes like ``RedCircle``, ``GreenCircle``, ``RedSquare``, ``GreenSquare``, etc.


## UseCase 

The Bridge Pattern is used in software development to decouple an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently. Here are some common use cases where the Bridge Pattern is beneficial:

* ``Supporting Multiple Platforms:`` When building software that needs to run on multiple platforms (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux), the Bridge Pattern can help separate the platform-specific implementation details from the high-level logic.

* ``Graphical User Interfaces:`` In GUI frameworks, the Bridge Pattern is often used to separate the abstraction of UI components (like buttons or windows) from their platform-specific rendering and behavior.

* ``Database Drivers:`` When creating an application that needs to support multiple database systems, the Bridge Pattern allows for separating the database-agnostic operations from the database-specific implementations.

* ``Device Drivers:`` In scenarios where software needs to interface with different hardware devices, the Bridge Pattern can abstract the device's capabilities from the specific hardware implementation.

* ``Remote APIs:`` When dealing with different remote APIs, the Bridge Pattern can abstract the business logic from the API-specific communication details.

* ``File Systems:`` Implementing support for different file systems (e.g., local, cloud-based) can benefit from the Bridge Pattern by separating file operations from the file system specifics.

* ``Media Players:`` In media applications, separating the abstraction of media controls from the underlying media formats or playback mechanisms can allow for flexibility and scalability.
