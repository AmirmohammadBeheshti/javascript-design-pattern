## Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across a system.

## Advantages
* ``Controlled Access to Single Instance``: Ensures that there is precisely one instance of a class, providing a global point of access.

* ``Reduced Namespace Pollution``: Avoids the need for global variables, reducing the potential for name conflicts.

* ``Lazy Initialization``: The singleton instance is created only when it is needed, which can improve performance and resource management.

* ``Flexibility``: The class has control over the instantiation process, making it easy to change the number of instances and the creation logic.

## Why Use Singleton Pattern

* ``Resource Management``: When a single instance is sufficient to manage a shared resource, such as a database connection or a configuration object, the singleton pattern can ensure efficient resource management.

* ``Global Access Point``: It provides a global access point to an instance, which can be useful for logging, driver objects, caching, thread pools, and configuration settings.

* ``Consistency``: Ensures that all parts of the application use the same instance, maintaining consistency across the application.

## When to Use Singleton Pattern
* ``Logging``: To ensure that all parts of the application log through the same instance, maintaining a single point of access to log files.

* ``Configuration Settings``: When an application requires a central configuration manager that holds settings and preferences.
